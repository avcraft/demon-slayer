    <h2>Hashiras standing on defence of Demon Slayer Catholic Corps</h2>
    <h3>Breath of Christ Total Concentration</h3>
    <p>To rise as a Catholic Hashira in the relentless spiritual battlefield, one must master the Breath of Christ Total Concentration. Your foe is not flesh and blood, but the insidious demons of despair, temptation, and doubt, constantly seeking to corrupt. Your training begins with the Form of the Rosary, each Hail Mary a focused thrust, each decade a relentless volley of spiritual energy that purifies the air and weakens the adversary's grasp.</p>

    <h3>The Holy Eucharist</h3>
<p>You must consume the ultimate healing wisteria the Holy Eucharist drawing immeasurable strength and renewal into your very spirit, solidifying your resolve against the demonic poisons. Confession is your spiritual Nichirin Blade refinement, purging the impurities that dull your edge and empowering you to face sin head-on. The Scriptures are your ancient scrolls of demonology, revealing the enemy's weaknesses and guiding your strategic strikes.
</p>

<h3>Full Focus</h3>
<p>A true Hashira maintains unbroken communion with the Divine Master through ceaseless prayer, a silent, internal "Full Focus" that never wanes, even amidst chaos. With unwavering faith as your unyielding will, and the Sacraments as your honed forms, you shall not merely withstand the night, but become a blazing pillar of light, protecting the innocent and relentlessly driving the darkness back to the shadows from whence it came.</p>
