    <p class="about-p">The Sanctum Slayers of the Holy See
For two millennia, since the very dawn of grace, we've stood as humanity's unwavering shield against the encroaching darkness. We are the Demon Slayer Catholic Corps, forged in divine fire and sworn to an eternal covenant. This isn't just history; it's a silent, sacred war against the infernal hordes.</p>

<p class="about-p">order, shrouded in mystery, carries a lineage unbroken. We are the Kishidan no Seiken—Knights of the Holy Blade—wielding faith not as dogma, but as potent Breathing Techniques of the Spirit. Every teaching, every prayer, every sacrament is a honed technique, a spiritual Form designed to purify the soul and utterly annihilate the demonic.</p> 

<p class="about-p">A rigorous hierarchy guides our every move, with ten levels of spiritual and martial prowess defining our ranks. From the initial Neophytes of the Creed mastering sacred scriptures, to the peerless Archbishops of the Holy Blade who channel the heavens themselves—each rank signifies deeper understanding and greater mastery over the insidious arts of demon slaying.</p> 

<p class="about-p">We identify the Seven Deadly Demons and their lesser manifestations, understanding their weaknesses and the divine countermeasures to banish them. Confession is our Spiritual Cleansing Breath, purging impurities. Communion, our Sacred Sustenance of the Soul, replenishing divine energy for the endless trials.</p> 

<p class="about-p">The Demon Slayer Catholic Corps stands ready. Our two-millennia vigil will never falter until every last demon is banished to the abyss.</p>
